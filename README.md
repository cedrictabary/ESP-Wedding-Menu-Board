# ESP-Wedding-Menu-Board

I designed a menu board for my wedding based on an ESP8266 D1 Mini board.

HD44780 20x04 LCD screen with I2C converter for the menu display.

7-segment display controlled by a TM1637 for the table number.

# Pinning

Pin D7 is used as PWM output to control LCD brightness with a NPN/PNP switch to provide power directly from VCC.

Pin D5 D6 are used as CLK/DIO to control the TM1637 chip.

Pin D1 D2 are used as SDA/SCL to control the LCD display.
